## Hi there, I'm Raphael Lee 👋

I’m a UX/UI designer and front-end developer who approaches digital products through both design intuition and technical reasoning. My academic background began in Computer Science and later evolved into Graphic Information Technology, giving me an engineering-informed perspective on user experience and interface design.

I’ve worked on a wide range of practical projects across web and mobile environments, focusing on translating complex ideas into clear, usable interfaces. My experience includes team leadership as an engineering lead, where I collaborated closely with designers and developers to build scalable, interaction-driven products.

I believe that good design is not just about visuals, but about how people feel and behave when interacting with a product. I’m particularly interested in creating experiences that are intuitive, engaging, and grounded in real user needs. By combining thoughtful design decisions with clean, maintainable code, I aim to build digital experiences that are both functional and meaningful.
